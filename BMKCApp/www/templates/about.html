            <h4>BeerMeKC is the definitive app for beer aficionados in the Kansas City Area.   Enter your preferences – beer type, alcohol by volume (ABV), and international bittering units (IBU) and be prepared to send your palate on a wondrous tour.  BeerMeKC will present you with a recommended beer.  If you like the recommendation – tap “Get It” and we’ll show you how.  For those swipers out there:  A swipe left means “Nah…not a fan of that one.”  A swipe right means “Sounds good, just not right now.”  Swipe down if you really don’t like it.  Swipe up if you love it and want it to be a top recommendation.<br></h4></div>

            <h4>Just so you know, we are an app for those who love a good local beer.  If you want watered down, recycled beer – just get on I-70 and head east or west.  If that doesn’t apply to you, then go hit BeerMe!   Seriously, why are you still reading this…do we need a button on this page for you?  Fine…
